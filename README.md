# ros_helper

The `ros_helper` package provides various helper classes/methods/nodes/messages
for [ROS1](https://www.ros.org/). Over the years, I find myself repeating a lot
of code when developing ROS packages. As a response, I started to collect these
common snippets into one helpful package.

Feel free to clone and use `ros_helper` inside your catkin workspace, or
copy/paste/modify any of the scripts for your projects.
