# ros_helper

A collection of helper scripts and nodes for [ROS](https://www.ros.org/). For instructions, explanations, and examples see the wiki [here](https://github.com/cmower/ros_helper/wiki). 

## Todo

### Short term 

* Update `keyboard_node` to use `simple_pub_sub`
* Proper exception handling and colored logging to terminal.
* Update other classes in `simple_pub_sub` to be aligned with the new updates to publisher.

### Long term

* Move to Python 3
* Documentation (Wiki).
* A C++ version and helper functionality specific to C++. 
* Make public.
* Tentative:
  * Move main functionality of `ros_helper` to C++ and wrap around with Python (e.g. Pybind).
