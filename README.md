# ros_helper

ROS helper package. Provides various helper classes/nodes/messages. When writing
code for ROS, I find that a lot of code is repeated, the
`ros_helper.node.RosNode` class provides a bunch of methods I use most often.
When using joysticks, see `ros_helper.joy`. Also included are some helpful
nodes/scripts.
