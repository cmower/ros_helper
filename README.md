# ros_helper

The `ros_helper` package provides various helper classes/methods/nodes/messages for
[ROS1](https://www.ros.org/). Over the years, when I have been developing ROS
packages, a lot of code is repeated. This package is a central collection of a
bunch of code that I find myself repeating a lot. 

Feel free to clone and use the `ros_helper` repo inside your catkin workspace,
or copy/paste/modify any of the scripts for your projects.
