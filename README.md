# ros_helper

**WARNING**: don't clone this repository in it's current state to your catkin
workspace `src/` directory. The `archive/` will create issues when building. I
recommend you clone `ros_helper` repository somewhere else (e.g. `~/Documents`)
and then create a symbolic link in your catkin workspace `src/` directory that
points to `ros_helper/` in this repository.
